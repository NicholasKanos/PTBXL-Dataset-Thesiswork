# PTB-XL ECG Classification Models

This repository contains multiple deep learning models developed and tested on the [PTB-XL ECG dataset](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/). The models use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformer architectures, and basic neural networks to detect and classify ECG abnormalities.

## Notebook Descriptions

| Notebook                  | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `PTBXL_CNN.ipynb`         | A convolutional neural network (CNN) implementation trained on 500 Hz ECG waveforms to classify multiple diagnostic labels. |
| `PTBXL_CNN_WandB.ipynb`   | An enhanced CNN model that integrates Weights & Biases (WandB) logging for experiment tracking and performance visualization. |
| `PTBXL NN.ipynb`          | A simple, fully-connected neural network (NN) for baseline performance comparison on the PTB-XL dataset. |
| `PTBXL Transformer.ipynb` | A transformer-based model that applies self-attention to ECG time-series, supporting multi-label classification. |
| `TransformerOSC.ipynb`    | A full pipeline transformer model that runs in the OSC environment. This notebook includes dataset downloading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation â€” all in one place. |
